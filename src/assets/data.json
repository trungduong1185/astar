                    "description": "Prof. Tu Vu is currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech and a Faculty Researcher at Google. He earned his PhD from the University of Massachusetts Amherst under the supervision of Mohit Iyyer and previously worked as a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. His research aims to advance and democratize artificial intelligence in the era of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on improving core LLM capabilities such as reasoning and instruction following, as well as their use in evaluation (e.g., LLM-as-a-Critic). He is also deeply engaged in transfer learning across tasks, modalities, and languages; efficient model updating with factual and real-time information; and parameter-efficient adaptation of LLMs to new domains, especially in low-resource settings. He actively bridges research and real-world impact through both academic mentorship and industrial collaboration, with a long-term vision of making powerful AI systems more accessible, adaptable, and aligned."
